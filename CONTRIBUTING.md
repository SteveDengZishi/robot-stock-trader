## WorkFlow

#### Trunk Based Workflow
1. We will be using Trunk Based Workflow
2. Each person create their own working branch since the start of sprint 0
3. We divide and assign task to individuals and merge them back when there is a bug free contribution
4. When making a pull request and merging to branch, make sure at least one other teammate review and approve your code

## Conflict Resolving

* Since we have a relative small group size of 3, efficiency and rapid decision making is the key
* We listen to all group members' ideas and blueprints and decide a direction based on vote (2 or more)
* To prevent conflict, we assign and divide task beforehand
* Notify all members if you are making changes and improvements that is not your assigned task
* Feel free to offer ideas and give a hand to your teammates after notifying them.

## Progress Tracking

* Scheduled reasonable amount of task for each sprint, the first sprint can be used as a test, and adjust accordingly
* Rotate scrum master and product owner role in every sprint
* In case someone is not able to complete their task, voice ahead of deadline and try to get help asap
* If some tasks marked incomplete at the end of the sprint, vote and re-evalute task during stand-up and vote for priority or abortion

## Daily Stand-Up Schedule

* Mon/Wed/Fri 15 mins on slack during lunch time 12pm-12:15pm
* Tues/Thurs in person 15 mins after class
* Then we will pace ourselves and work remotely on individual task

## Rules for Prioritizing Backlog

* Platform first then algorithm
* We want to create the login web platform first for users to check their portfolio, choosing investing strategies, then inventing algorithms that can beat the market.
