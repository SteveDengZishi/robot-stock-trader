# Requirements

## Stakeholder Interviews
TBD.

## End-User Observation

## Use Cases 
We anticipate that the sole actor of the system will be the user / customer, since there will not be any admin roles besides the developers themselves. The primary and sole use case of this product that we plan to develop and optimize for is to automate trading with the stock market based on individual preferences. Below is an outline of this use case:

Title: Trading Securities
Actor: Customer

Scenario: Customer creates an account with a username and password for secure login in the future. Customer answers a series of questions regarding her investment preferences. This can include whether she would like to invest over a long or short period of time, approximately how much capital she plans to allocate, and the level of risk she is willing to take on. The system evaluates her responses using a predefined decision model and selects an algorithm. Customer views visualizations and performance results of the algorithm based on backtesting. Customer decides on whether to allocate real capital to the algorithm. System trades with the user's capital using the selected algorithm and displays results on the web interface. Customer views trading progress and key performance indicators over time through the web interface. Customer terminates trading whenever she desires.  

Below is a diagram of this use case.
